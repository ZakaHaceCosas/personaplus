## Give yourself a plus!

**PersonaPlus** is an open source, work in progress app intended to help you create healthy routines & habits so you give yourself a better life. "Give yourself a plus", like we like to say.

### Download the app

> [!DANGER]
> Note that as the app isn't done yet, we may change how data is stored, making you **loose your data** from one preapp release to another. Don't use (just yet :wink:) PersonaPlus as your daily companion app.

PersonaPlus is still under development (CURRENT STAGE: "PRE-APP"). You can try out the app downloading a pre-release version from the [releases page](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus/releases). **No version is stable / finished**, so expect issues & missing features. As an early app, we kindly ask you to [report here any issue you find](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus/issues). Thank you!

PersonaPlus' interface is available in English and Spanish.

## Planned features, roadmap, and more

Many features we promised are in development and either:

- Not available at all.
- Hidden behind the "Experiments" tab on the app's settings.
- Available, but with limited functionality or known bugs.

You can see everything that's planned and our progress on it via our tracking issues & [roadmap GitHub project](https://github.com/users/ZakaHaceCosas/projects/1/views/1).

We also use GitHub milestones to mark stages of development, from "PRE-APP" to "ALPHA" to "BETA"... all the way until a stable release. New issues made by users will be added to one milestone or another based on the priority we give them.

## How to contribute?

PersonaPlus is a 100% free an open source app, and as such, accepts contributions from anyone. [Simply follow the steps here!](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) We're really thankful for all contributions.
