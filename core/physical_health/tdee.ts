/**
 * Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) based on the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and on given parameters.
 * @param age The age of the subject.
 * @param gender The gender of the subject (either "male" or "female").
 * @param weight The weight of the subject in kilograms (KG).
 * @param height The height of the subject in centimeters (CM).
 * @param activeness From "poor" to "extreme", how active the subject is in terms of exercising, being "poor" very little or no exercise, light 1 to 3 days of exercise a week (being one time each day), moderate 3 to 5 days a week, intense 6 or seven days a week, and extreme being very intense exercises and/or more than once a day.
 * @returns A standard `CoreLibraryResponse` with the desired results.
