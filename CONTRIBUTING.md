## Contributing with code

### 0. Make a fork

### 1. Clone it

On your local PC, run:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_FORK.git
```

with your fork's real git URL. Then open the folder.

### 2. Ensure you're on the right branch

```bash
git branch
```

It should show `main` marked with an asterisk.

```bash
* main
  (other branches we don't care about)
```

If the asterisk _is not in `main`_, change to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 3. Install deps

You'll require of NodeJS and NPM for that. Please use `npm`.

```bash
npm install
